## CommandConsole
类CommandConsole类似于命令行、游戏控制台等指令工具,可以通过输入一个字符串完成函数调用,尤其是在程序发布以后，可以在exe程序运行时输入字符串修改内存中的变量或者查询目标变量值。<br />
The class CommandConsole is similar to command-line tools or game consoles, allowing functions to be called by entering a string. This is especially useful after the program is released, as it enables modification of variables in memory or querying the values of target variables during the execution of the executable program by entering strings.<br />
